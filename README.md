# Password Generator
## Description
This is a password generator web application that allows users to create a unique and secure password. The user can choose the length of the password and specify which types of characters to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters). The app will then generate a random password based on the user's preferences.

The motivation for this project was to provide a simple and convenient way for users to create strong passwords for their online accounts. With the increasing number of data breaches and cyber attacks, it is important for users to use strong and unique passwords for their online accounts. This app aims to make it easy for users to create and manage secure passwords.
